# Better Footnotes

An enhanced footnote workflow plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that streamlines footnote management with intelligent auto-numbering, custom prompts, and automatic sorting.

## Features

### üîÑ **Smart Auto-Numbering**

-   Automatically renumbers all footnotes sequentially (1, 2, 3...) based on their order of appearance in the text
-   Maintains consistency even when footnotes are added, removed, or reordered
-   Ignores original footnote labels and creates a clean, sequential numbering system

### üìù **Enhanced Insert Experience**

-   Replaces Obsidian's default footnote insertion with a custom command
-   Shows an intuitive modal dialog to input footnote text
-   Supports keyboard shortcuts (Enter to confirm, Escape to cancel)
-   Maintains the familiar `Ctrl/Cmd + ^` hotkey

### üóÇÔ∏è **Intelligent Organization**

-   Automatically sorts footnote definitions at the bottom of the file
-   Orders definitions to match the sequence of references in the text
-   Preserves proper spacing and formatting
-   Handles mixed content gracefully

### üíæ **Built-in Backup System**

-   Creates automatic backups before making changes
-   Timestamps backup files for easy identification
-   Automatic cleanup of backups older than 30 days
-   Stores backups in the plugin's dedicated folder

## Installation

### From Obsidian Community Plugins (Recommended)

1. Open Obsidian Settings
2. Navigate to Community Plugins
3. Search for "Better Footnotes"
4. Click Install and Enable

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/obsidian-better-footnotes/releases)
2. Extract the files to your vault's `.obsidian/plugins/better-footnotes/` directory
3. Reload Obsidian and enable the plugin in Settings > Community Plugins

## Usage

### Creating Footnotes

1. **Use the keyboard shortcut**: Press `Ctrl/Cmd + ^` (same as default Obsidian)
2. **Use the command palette**: Search for "Insert footnote"
3. **Enter your footnote text** in the modal dialog
4. The plugin will automatically:
    - Insert the footnote reference at your cursor position
    - Add the footnote definition at the bottom of the file
    - Number it sequentially based on existing footnotes

### Example Workflow

**Before:**

```markdown
This is some text with a footnote[^note1] and another[^xyz].

[^xyz]: Second footnote
[^note1]: First footnote
```

**After using Better Footnotes:**

```markdown
This is some text with a footnote[^1] and another[^2].

[^1]: First footnote
[^2]: Second footnote
```

### Renumbering Existing Footnotes

The plugin automatically renumbers footnotes whenever you insert a new one. All footnote references and definitions are updated to maintain sequential order based on their appearance in the text.

## Key Benefits

-   **Consistency**: Never worry about footnote numbering again
-   **Clean Organization**: Footnotes are always properly ordered and formatted
-   **Safety**: Automatic backups protect your work
-   **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing Obsidian workflows
-   **Performance**: Efficient processing even with many footnotes
